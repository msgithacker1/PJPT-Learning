# Passive Recon Overview

## Passive Recon Information Gathering:

* Location info: can be done through drone recon, scanning physical break-in areas, identifying card readers and security guards etc.



* Job info: employees that work at the target organisation, their roles, their phone numbers, their pictures etc.



* Web/Host info: can include target validation (to make sure you're attacking the right target), finding subdomains, fingerprinting (what software/ports/services are running on the target machines), finding information on previous data breaches
