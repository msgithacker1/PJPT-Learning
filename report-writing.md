# Report Writing

## Reports:

* Reports highlight non-technical and technical findings of an ethical hack
* They include recommendations for remediation (improvement) that are clear for executives (non-technical people) and technical staff
* The report is usually given within a week after engagement

***

## Debriefs:

* These are when the ethical hacker walks through the report findings, as a draft.
* Debriefs can happen with technicals and non-technicals (colloquial terms for technical and non-technical staff I made up myself).
* Debriefs include an opportunity for the client to ask questions and clarify information before the final report is released.
