# Different Types of Pentest

###

External Network Pentests (most common, usually a cheaper option):

\= As the name suggests, it's assessing an organisation's security from the outside\
\= Focuses on OSINT Gathering (Open Source Intelligence) - gathering as much data as we can about the organisation\
\= Has time for attacking and report-writing depending on scope of attack

***

Internal Network Pentests:

\= Assessing an organisation's security from the inside of the network\
\= Focuses on AD attacks\
\= Has time for attacking and report-writing depending on scope of attack



```python
##This is just some test code in Python

for x in range(0,3):
    print(x)
```

***

Web App Pentest:

\= Assessing an organisation's web application security\
\= Focuses on web-based attacks and OWASP testing guidelines (Open Web Application Security Project) - testing guidelines (e.g., how to test, how to defend etc.)\
\= Has time for attacking and report-writing depending on scope of attac

***

Wireless Network Pentest:

\= Assessing an organisation's wireless network security\
\= Focuses on type of wireless being used (e.g., guest vs WPA2-PSK (Pre-Share Key - common in households) vs WPA2 Enterprise)\
\= Has time for attacking (around 6 hours per SSID) and report writing (around 2 hours) but can depend on scope of attack

***

Physical Network Pentest:

\= Assessing an organisation's physical security and/or end-user training (e.g., social engineering)\
\= Focuses on different tasks and goals to assess physical security\
\= Has time for attacking and report writing depending on scope of attack

***

Purple Teaming:

\= Involves mixing red and blue teaming (to make purple)\
\= Checks are done to see if red teamers' attacks show up on the blue, defensive side\
\= More of a mature process for a more in-depth analysis and to improve detection mechanisms

***

Pentest vs Red-Teaming:

\= Conducting pentests involves you being aware of IP addresses, the scope of attack and limitation of attacks to perform\
\= Pentests are also more short on time

***

\= Red teaming involves more stealth and creativity - you have to find most of this info yourself\
\= Much longer period of attack (e.g., months, years etc.)
