  conducted.

# Different Types of Pentest

## External Network Pentests:

* Most common, usually a cheaper option.
* As the name suggests, it's an assessment of an organisation's security from the outside.
* Focuses on OSINT Gathering (Open Source Intelligence) - gathering as much data as we can about the organisation.
* Has time for attacking and report-writing depending on scope of attack.

***

## Internal Network Pentests:

* Assessing an organisation's security from the inside of the network.
* Focuses on Active Directory (AD) attacks.
* Has time for attacking and report-writing depending on scope of attack.

***

## Web Application Pentests:

* Assessing an organisation's web application security.
* Focuses on web-based attacks and OWASP testing guidelines (Open Web Application Security Project) - testing guidelines (e.g., how to test, how to defend etc.).
* Has time for attacking and report-writing depending on scope of attack.

***

## Wireless Network Pentests:

* Assessing an organisation's wireless network security.
* Focuses on type of wireless being used (e.g., guest vs WPA2-PSK (Pre-Share Key - common in households) vs WPA2 Enterprise).
* Has time for attacking (around 6 hours per SSID) and report writing (around 2 hours) but can depend on scope of attack.

***

## Physical Network Pentests:

* Assessing an organisation's physical security and/or end-user training (e.g., social engineering).
* Focuses on different tasks and goals to assess physical security.
* Has time for attacking and report writing depending on scope of attack.

***

## Purple Teaming:

* Involves mixing red and blue teaming (to make purple).
* Checks are done to see if red teamers' attacks show up on the blue, defensive side.
* More of a mature process for a more in-depth analysis and to improve detection mechanisms.

## Pentesting vs Red Teaming:

* Conducting pentests involves you being aware of IP addresses, the scope of attack and limitation of attacks to perform.
* Pentests are also more short on time.
* Red teaming involves more stealth and creativity - you have to find most of this info yourself.
* Red teaming has a much longer period of attack (e.g., months, years etc.).
