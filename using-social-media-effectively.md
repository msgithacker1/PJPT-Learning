# Using Social Media Effectively

Tips:

* USE TWITTER AND LINKEDIN. This is particularly useful for finding people and information on those people. Information you can gather can include photos, roles, backgrounds, authority, email addresses etc.
* People are always one of the weaker security points of an organisation. There may well be slip-ups online despite security policies. Look online.&#x20;
