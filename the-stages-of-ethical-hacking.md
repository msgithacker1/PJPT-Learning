# The Stages of Ethical Hacking

## 1. Reconnaissance

Finding out information about your target. Broken down into:

* Active Recon: Using tools against the target to scan and look for vulnerabilities like open ports and services running.
* Passive Recon: Finding information through non-technical means. Can be things like Google searching employees, satellite views of the target building, stalking on social media etc.

***

## 2. Scanning & Enumeration

Overlaps with active reconnaissance. Enumeration is the process of digging further into the information you found and trying to see if there's anything of value.

***

## 3. Exploitation/Gaining Access

Try to get access to the system and/or run a series of attacks against it.

***

## 4. Maintain Access

Try to stay within the system and monitor your victim as you run your attacks.

***

## 5. Covering Tracks

"Clean up" after your attack. Make it seem as though you never invaded. Remove signs of attack as best as you can
