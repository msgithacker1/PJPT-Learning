# Google Tips & Tricks

## Filtering Websites:

* Use "site:\[domain]" to filter results in Google to get information on the domain website&#x20;
* Slap on "-www" after this to get subdomains for the domain too (an alternative to the subdomain-discovery tools we used before). This "takes away" 'www' from the domain to get the subdomains&#x20;
* Slap on "-\[subdomain]" after this to get results that don't have the subdomain&#x20;



Example:

"site:tesla.com -www -ir"

***

## Finding Files:

* Add "filetype:\[filetype]" to your search to find a specific file type associated with your search
* When paired with a website search, it will look for files of this type on that website&#x20;



Example:

"site:tesla.com filetype:docx"&#x20;
